The two-sided t-test is carried out by
x<-rnorm(100); mytest<-t.test(x)
or simply by
mytest<-t.test(rnorm(100))
The variable “mytest” contains the results, which can be displayed by
mytest
The structure of the variable “mytest” can be displayed by
str(mytest)
and contains all information about the test. For example, the p-value, the observed value of the test-statistic, and a 95% confidence interval for the population mean μ can be extracted by:
mytest$p.value; mytest$statistic; mytest$conf.int
A. Simulate k = 104 random samples of size n = 10 from the standard-normal distribution, apply t-tests to all of them, extract the p-values, and plot them in the form of a histogram.
